			<h2>Business Aim/Tasks</h2>

			<p>The business start from one person and has now grown with more then 2 fleets of on the road. 
				With the word of more and some advertisment it allow for more of the community to know about 
				the business which allowed it to grow. The main purpose the owner had when making the business
				was what would happen if you don't want to move the computer/technology as you think it might 
				a reason for the problem. By having the experience people who have been trained and know what 
				they are doing come to your door, this allows for the technician to have a better understanding 
				in why this happens and put more time to fixing it. When customers bring there technology to the shop 
				it forces the technician to try and recreate the problem but by have the technician come to you 
				allow the technician to complete their task quicker.

			<p class="parallax_description">
				Bob Franklen one of the most skill technician in the team has proven why it is easier for them by doing this as he stated: "By the time we arrive to house/business with 
				any technical problems we can complete our tasks within a small margin of time, but when the customers bring the device in to have a look or get fix we usually try to 
				recreate the problem allowing for us to solve it which this could take from 5 minutes upto days depending on the severity of the problem"
				This commit from Bob Has allowed the customers understand what they most of the time do for there customers and by having them selves travel to the problem allows for a quick 
				solution.
